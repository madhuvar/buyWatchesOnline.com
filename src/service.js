        <h3>Preparation for servicing</h3>
        <p>The movement, still fitted with its dial and hands, is removed from the case from which the bracelet has already been detached. The movement, case and bracelet will follow separate paths during servicing before being reassembled at the end of the process.</p>
        <h3>Dismantling of the movement</h3>
        <p>The movement is entirely dismantled and all the parts are carefully examined. Those that no longer meet Rolex requirements are systematically replaced.</p>
        <h3>Assembly and lubrication of the movement</h3>
        <p>The cleaned components are dried, after which the movement is entirely reassembled and lubricated. The wSatchmaker makes the first adjustments to the precision of the movement according to the brand’s accuracy criteria.</p>
        <h3>Refinishing of the case and bracelet</h3>
        <p>The case is completely disassembled and the middle case, bezel, case back and bracelet are re-polished or satin-finished according to their original finish. These delicate operations require great care and dexterity.</p>
        <h3>Assembly of the case</h3>
        <p>After being cleaned and refinished, the case parts are reassembled and the seals replaced. The case is tested for waterproofness.</p>
        <h3>Casing of the movement</h3>
        <p>The movement – to which the dial and hands have been refitted – is put back into the case once the watchmaker has performed rigorous technical and aesthetic checks of all these elements.</p>
        <h3>Precision test</h3>
        <p>After casing the movement, the watchmaker measures its chronometric precision once again and makes any final adjustments necessary for it to meet Rolex requirements.</p>
        <h3>Returning the watch</h3>
        <p>At the end of the service procedure, your watch is returned to you in a protective pouch and accompanied by an international two-year service guarantee covering replacement parts and labour.</p>
